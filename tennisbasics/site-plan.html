          What is tennis?<br><br>
        </div>
        Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.<br><br>

          Gameplay<br><br>
        </div>
          A game of tennis consists of a number of games which make up a set. <br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Game<br><br>
        </div>
        A standard game consists of a minimum of 4 points. The score of the server is called first, and goes as follows:<br>
        No point = “Love” | First point = “15” | Second Point = “30” | Third Point = “40” | Fourth Point = “Game”<br>
        For example, if the server wins the first point, the score is “15 – Love”. If the receiver wins the first point, the score will be “Love – 15”. The game is won when a player wins 4 points with at least 2 clear points. If each player wins three points, the score will be “40-40”. This is known as “DEUCE”. After Deuce, the score will be “ADVANTAGE” to the player who wins the point. If that same player wins the next point, they will win the game. If they lose the point, the score will return to Deuce.<br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Set<br><br>
        </div>
        A Set consists of 6 Games and is won by the first player to reach 6 games, with at least a 2 game lead.
        At the start of a set, Player A will serve for the duration of the first game. The players will then switch ends of the court, and Player B will then commence serving. After this, the player will continue to switch ends every 2 games.
        If a set goes to 5-5, the set will be extended to 7.
        If the set reaches 6-6, the winner of the set will be determined in a “Tie break”.<br><br>

      <h3>Rules</h3>

        <div class="subtitle">
          Rules of the Game <br><br>
        </div>
          -In a game of singles, 2 players play against each other. In a game of doubles, it’s 2 vs. 2.<br>
          -Each tennis player stands on opposite sides of the net and uses a tennis racket to hit the ball back and forth.<br>
          -The point starts with one of the players performing a serve to the box diagonal to them, and the other player attempting to return the serve.<br>
          -A serve must bounce in the service box before it can be returned.<br>
          -If the server misses the service box, this is considered a FAULT. In this case, the player has a second chance to put the ball in play. This is known as a SECOND SERVE.<br>
          -If the server misses the second serve, this will be classed as a DOUBLE FAULT and the server will lose the point.<br>
          -If the serve hits the net cord and bounces inside the correct service box, this is called a LET and the serve is repeated.<br>
          -If the opponent fails to return a valid serve, the point goes to the server.<br>
          -Once in play, each player will attempt to win the point by keeping the ball within the court and preventing the opponent from getting the ball back or forcing them to make a mistake.<br>
          -The point will end when someone misses the ball, hits the ball out of the court or into the net, or the ball bounces twice.<br>
          -If the ball hits the net cord and bounces over the net (on the correct side), the point continues.<br>
          -When in play, the player cannot touch the net or net post, or cross over onto the opponent’s side of the court. If they do, this player will lose the point.<br>
          -A player can only hit the ball once before returning it to the other side of the net.<br>
          -The boundary lines of the court are considered part of the court. If a ball hits the line, it is considered to be IN.<br><br>

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        <div class="subtitle">
          What happens if the ball hits the net post and bounces in?<br> 
        </div>
          As the net posts are considered to be part of the net, if the ball hits the net post and then bounces inside the court, the point continues. However, this only applies in a rally and not to a serve. <br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          What happens if a tennis ball hits a player?<br>
        </div>
        Whilst the ball is in play, a player can only touch the ball with his tennis racket. If the ball touches the player on any part of their body or clothing, the player will lose the point.<br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can you touch the net in tennis?<br>
        </div>
        No, you can’t touch the net in tennis. A player can’t touch the net until the point is over, with any part of their body, clothing, or racket. If  a player touches the net or runs into it, they will lose the point.  <br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can you throw your racket in tennis?<br>
        </div>
        No, a player can’t throw their racket to hit the ball. In order for the shot to count, the racket must be in the player’s hand when the ball is hit. However, if the racket is released/dropped after the ball is hit, the point will continue. <br><br> 
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can a player whiff the ball?<br>
        </div>
        Yes, a player can whiff (a stroke in which the player misses the ball completely) the ball when it’s in play or during a rally. However, during a serve, if the player tosses the ball, swings for a serve and misses or whiffs the ball, and the ball then bounces, this is considered a fault (Note: if the player whiffs the ball on serve, they may still attempt to hit it before the ball bounces!)<br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can any player call a let in tennis?<br>
        </div>
        Each player or team is responsible for line calls for shots landing on their own side of the net. A player or team is not allowed to make calls for balls landing on the opponent’s side of the net. However, as the net is considered to be in the middle, any player can call a let during a serve.<br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can you reach over the net in tennis?<br>
        </div>
        Usually a player or their racket can’t cross over the plane of the net. However, a player can follow through with a swing across the net only when first making contact with the ball on their side of the net. <br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          What happens if a tennis ball spins back over the net?<br>
        </div>
        If the ball spins back over the net, or in other words bounces on one side and then bounces back without the opponent hitting it, the point goes to the player that hit the ball, assuming the opponent can’t and doesn’t get to the ball.  If the opponent can indeed get to the ball, the player may reach over the net to hit the ball. This is the only scenario in which a player may hit the ball on the other side of the net. <br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can you double hit in tennis?<br>
        </div>
        If a player hits the ball twice, unintentionally and during a single swing of the racket, the shot is valid. <br><br>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Can you hit the ball around the net in tennis?<br>
        </div>
        Yes, you can hit the ball around the net in tennis.<br><br>
