                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">What happens if the ball hits the net post and bounces in?</h2>
                    <p>As the net posts are considered to be part of the net, if the ball hits the net post and then bounces inside the court, the point continues. However, this only applies in a rally and not to a serve.</p>

                <div class="p2">
                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">Can you throw your racket in tennis?</h2>
                    <p>No, a player can't throw their racket to hit the ball. In order for the shot to count, the racket must be in the player's hand when the ball is hit. However, if the racket is released/dropped after the ball is hit, the point will continue.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">What happens if a tennis ball spins back over the net?</h2>
                    <p>If the ball spins back over the net, or in other words, bounces on one side and then bounces back without the opponent hitting it, the point goes to the player that hit the ball, assuming the opponent can't and doesn't get to the ball. If the opponent can indeed get to the ball, the player may reach over the net to hit the ball. This is the only scenario in which a player may hit the ball on the other side of the net.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">Can you double hit in tennis?</h2>
                    <p>If a player hits the ball twice, unintentionally and during a single swing of the racket, the shot is valid.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">What happens if a tennis ball hits a player?</h2>
                    <p>Whilst the ball is in play, a player can only touch the ball with their tennis racket. If the ball touches the player on any part of their body or clothing, the player will lose the point.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">Can any player call a let in tennis?</h2>
                    <p>Each player or team is responsible for line calls for shots landing on their own side of the net. A player or team is not allowed to make calls for balls landing on the opponent's side of the net. However, as the net is considered to be in the middle, any player can call a let during a serve.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">Can you touch the net in tennis?</h2>
                    <p>No, you can't touch the net in tennis. A player can't touch the net until the point is over, with any part of their body, clothing, or racket. If a player touches the net or runs into it, they will lose the point.</p>

                <div class="p8">
                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">Can you reach over the net in tennis?</h2>
                    <p>Usually a player or their racket can't cross over the plane of the net. Howevever, a player can follow through with a swing across the net only when first making contact with the ball on their side of the net.</p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle-faq">Can a player whiff the ball?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, a player can whiff (a stroke in which the player misses the ball completely) the ball when it's in play or during a rally. However, during a serve, if the player tosses the ball, swings for a serve and misses or whiffs the ball, and the ball then bounces, this is considered a fault. (Note: if the player whiffs the ball on serve, they may still atempt to hit it before the ball bounces!)</p>

                    <p>Yes, you can hit the ball around the net in tennis.</p>
