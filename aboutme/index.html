   <p style="text-align:center">Hello everyone! I'm starting my third semester at BYUI and am currently just working towards my generals degree. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">Some of my favorite class so far have been welding, child development, and psychology. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">My husband and I met in a Spanish class at BYUI and have been married for almost 6 months.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">Some of my interests include art, music (I play the piano, clarinet and alto saxophone), and sports (mainly tennis and soccer).</p>
    <p style="text-align:center">During my off-track I was working full-time doing HVAC work. It definitely wasn't easy (especially with my lack of experience), but it taught me a lot. </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">I chose to take this class because my husband had taken and enjoyed it. I'm also hoping to become a bit more tech savvy and find a potential major. </p>
